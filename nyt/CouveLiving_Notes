----- Chris's Notes 1/17/2017 -----
-MLS listings WordPress plugin?
	-MLS listings are shared via IDX (internet data exchange)
	-The broker needs MLS username and login for any MLS service to work - or rather just a long key like an API key. We may need to log into her account an generate an API key
	-Plugins where you enter in listings manually are free. MLS / IDX services costr money. still looking for free
	-Different MLS have different requirments on how to get the information. I'll need to know who she has the license through
	-Do able

	https://estatik.net/choose-your-version/
		-Mortgage calulator
		-cost $129 for MLS listings

	https://realtyna.com/shop/wpl-shop/
		-full set of realestate tools for $200. required for MLS listings
		-The free version does tons of stuff too
		-Look into this one more to make sure the free version wont work

	ihomefinder
		-way expensive nevermind
		-there may be a way to make the free version work if we alredy have a license
